<center><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p lingdex=3D"1"><b> Can I use different class names, method names,
or method signatures from those prescribed in the API?</b>
No, as usual, your assignment will not be graded if it violates the API.


</p><p lingdex=3D"2"><b> Is 0 a block?</b>
No, 0 represents the blank square. Do not treat it as a block when computin=
g either
the Hamming or Manhattan priority functions.

</p><p lingdex=3D"3"><b> Can I assume that the puzzle inputs (arguments to =
the Board constructor and input to Solver)
are valid?</b>
Yes, though it never hurts to include some basic error checking.

</p><p lingdex=3D"4"><b>Do I have to implement my own stack, queue, and pri=
ority queue?</b>
You must use either <tt>MinPQ</tt> or <tt>MaxPQ</tt> for your priority queu=
e (because we will intercept calls in
order to do performance analysis).
For the other data types, you may use versions from either <tt>algs4.jar</t=
t> or <tt>java.util</tt>.


</p><p lingdex=3D"5"><b>How do I return an <tt>Iterable&lt;Board&gt;</tt>?<=
/b>
Add the items you want to a <tt>Stack&lt;Board&gt;</tt>
or <tt>Queue&lt;Board&gt;</tt> and return that.

</p><p lingdex=3D"6"><b>How do I implement <tt>equals()</tt>?</b>
Java has some arcane rules for implementing <tt>equals()</tt>,
discussed on p. 103 of Algorithms, 4th edition.
Note that the argument to <tt>equals()</tt> is required to be <tt>Object</t=
t>.
You can also inspect
<a href=3D"http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/12oop/Date.java.html">Date.java</a=
>
or
<a href=3D"http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/12oop/Transaction.java.html">Trans=
action.java</a>
for online examples.


</p><p lingdex=3D"7"><b>Must I implement the <tt>toString()</tt> method for=
 <tt>Board</tt> exactly as specified?</b>
Yes. Be sure to include the board dimension and use 0 for the blank square.
Use <tt>String.format()</tt> to format strings=E2=80=94it works like <tt>St=
dOut.printf()</tt>, but
returns the string instead of printing it to standard output.
For reference, our implementation is below, but yours may vary depending on=
 your choice of
instance variables.

</p><blockquote>
<pre>public String toString() {
    StringBuilder s =3D new StringBuilder();
    s.append(N + "\n");
    for (int i =3D 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
        for (int j =3D 0; j &lt; N; j++) {
            s.append(String.format("%2d ", tiles[i][j]));
        }
        s.append("\n");
    }
    return s.toString();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<!--
<p><b>How should I implement the <tt>draw()</tt> method in <tt>Board</tt>?<=
/b>
It is intended primarily for debugging. You should draw a graphical represe=
ntation of
the board, similar to the output of the <tt>toString()</tt> method. You can
use <tt>StdDraw.text(x, y, s)</tt> (where <tt>s</tt> is a string that does =
not contain newlines) to draw the string <tt>s</tt>, centered on
(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>). You can also use
<tt>StdDraw.setFont(new Font("SansSerif", Font.PLAIN, 24));</tt> to change=
=20
the font size.
-->

<p lingdex=3D"8"><b>Should the <tt>hamming()</tt> and <tt>manhattan()</tt> =
methods
in <tt>Board</tt> return the Hamming and Manhattan priority functions, resp=
ectively?</b>
No, <tt>hamming()</tt> should return the number of blocks out of position a=
nd=20
<tt>manhattan()</tt> should return the sum of the Manhattan distances betwe=
en
the blocks and their goal positions. Recall that the blank square is not co=
nsidered a block.
You will compute the priority function
in <tt>Solver</tt> by calling <tt>hamming()</tt> or <tt>manhattan()</tt>
and adding to it the number of moves.

</p><p lingdex=3D"9"><b>I'm a bit confused about the purpose of the twin() =
method.</b>
You will use it to determine whether a puzzle is solvable: exactly one of
a board and its twin are solvable. A twin is obtained by swapping=20
any pair of blocks (the blank square is not a block).
For example, here is a board and several possible  twins.
Your solver will use only one twin.
</p><blockquote>
<pre>    1  3       3  1       1  3       1  3       1  3       6  3

</pre>
</blockquote>


<p lingdex=3D"10"><b> How do I reconstruct the solution once I've dequeued
the goal search node?</b>
Since each search node records the previous search node to get there,
you can chase the pointers all the way back to the initial
search node (and consider them in reverse order).

</p><p lingdex=3D"11"><b> Can I terminate the search as soon as a goal sear=
ch node is enqueued
(instead of dequeued)?</b>
No, even though it does lead to a correct solution for the slider
puzzle problem using the Hamming and Manhattan priority functions,
it's not technically the A* algorithm (and will not find the correct soluti=
on
for other problems and other priority functions).
<!--
Here=E2=80=99s a simple argument that checking the search node
when it is enqueued (instead of dequeued)=20
is correct here; moreover, it is (nearly) a correct implementation of the A=
* algorithm here.=20
When a goal search node s* is enqueued, it is because a neighboring search =
node s
is one move away from=20
the solution. Assume this neighbor s has hamming (or manhattan) priority k.=
 Since it is one=20
move away, its hamming (or manhattan) distance is 1, so the number of moves=
 to get there is=20
k-1. The goal search node s* has exactly the same priority k: its hamming (=
or manhattan) distance is=20
0 and its number of moves is k. Thus, if we enqueue s*, the A* algorithm ca=
n dequeue s* next=20
(and terminate) because s* has the minimum priority k. I guess, technically=
, the other=20
neighbors of s should be enqueued, but these will have higher priorities an=
d not be relevant.=20
-->

</p><p lingdex=3D"12"><b> I noticed that the priorities of the search nodes
dequeued from the priority queue
never decrease. Is this a property of the A* algorithm?</b>
Yes.
In the language of the A* algorithm, the Hamming and Manhattan distances (b=
efore
adding in the number of moves so far) are known as <em>heuristics</em>. If
a heuristic is both <em>admissible</em> (never overestimates the number of =
moves to
the goal search node) and <em>consistent</em> (satisfies a certain triangle=
 inequality),
then this noticed property is guaranteed.=20
The Hamming and Manhattan heuristics are both admissible and consistent.
You may use this noticed property as a debugging clue: if the priority of t=
he search node dequeued=20
from the priority queue decreases, then you know you did something wrong.

</p><p lingdex=3D"13"><b>Even with the critical optimization, the priority =
queue may contain two or more search nodes
corresponding to the same board. Should I try to eliminate these?</b>
In principle, you could do so with a set data type such as <tt>SET</tt> in =
<tt>algs4.jar</tt> or
<tt>java.util.TreeSet</tt> or <tt>java.util.HashSet</tt>
(provided that the <tt>Board</tt> data type were either <tt>Comparable</tt>=
 or had a <tt>hashCode()</tt>
method).
However, almost all of the benefit from avoiding duplicate boards is alread=
y
extracted from the critical optimization and the cost of identifying other =
duplicate=20
boards will be more than the remaining benefit from doing so.

</p><p lingdex=3D"14"><b>Can I put the logic for detecting whether a puzzle=
 is infeasible in
Board instead of Solver?</b>
There is a elegant algorithm for determining whether a board is solvable th=
at relies on a
parity argument (and occasionally we change our API to require this solutio=
n).
However, the current API requires you to detect infeasiblity
in <tt>Solver</tt> by using two synchronized A* searches (e.g., using two p=
riority queues).

</p><p lingdex=3D"15"><b>I run out of memory when running some of the large=
 sample puzzles. What should I do?</b>
Be sure to ask Java for additional memory,
e.g., <tt>java -Xmx1600m Solver puzzle36.txt</tt>.
We recommend running from the command line (and not from the DrJava interac=
tion pane).
You should expect to run out of memory when using the Hamming priority func=
tion.
Be sure not to put the JVM option in the wrong spot or it will be
treated as a command-line argument,=20
e.g., <tt>java Solver -Xmx1600m puzzle36.txt</tt>.


</p><p lingdex=3D"16"><b>My program can't solve puzzle4x4-hard1.txt or puzz=
le4x4-hard2.txt,
even if I give it a huge amount of space. What am I doing wrong?</b>
Probably nothing. The A* algorithm will struggle to solve even some 4-by-4 =
instances.

There were a total of 10 search nodes enqueued and 5 search nodes dequeued.
In general, the number of search nodes enqueued and dequeued may vary sligh=
tly, depending
the order in which the search nodes with equal priorities come off the prio=
rity queue,
which depends on the order in which <tt>neighbors()</tt>
returns the neighbors of a board. However, for this input, there are no suc=
h ties,
so you should have exactly 10 search nodes enqueued and 5 search nodes dequ=
eued.

The contents of our priority queue (sorted by priority)
just before dequeueing each node when using the Hamming priority function o=

turns out to be identical to the results above: for this input file, throug=
hout the A* algorithm,
a block is never more than one position away from its goal position, which =
implies that the
Hamming function and the Manhattan functions are equal.

Be sure to throughly test and debug it before proceding.

<p><li> Write a nested class <tt>SearchNode</tt> that represents a search n=

</p><p lingdex=3D"29"><b>How can I reduce the amount of memory a <tt>Board<=
/tt> uses?</b>
For starters, recall that an N-by-N <tt>int[][]</tt> array in Java uses
about 24 + 32N + 4N^2 bytes; when N equals 3, this is 156 bytes.
To save memory, consider using an <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> <tt>char[][]</tt=
> array
or a length <em>N</em>^2 <tt>char[]</tt> array.
In principle, each board is a permutation of size N^2, so you need only abo=

bits to represent it; when N equals 3, this is only 19 bits.

</p><p lingdex=3D"30"><b>Any ways to speed up the algorithm?</b>
Yes there are many opportunities for optimization here.
</p><ul>
<p lingdex=3D"31"></p><li> Use a 1d array instead of a 2d array (as suggest=
ed above).

<p lingdex=3D"32"></p></li><li> Cache either the Manhattan distance of a bo=
ard (or Manhattan=20
priority of a search node). It is waste to recompute the same quantity over
and over again.

<p lingdex=3D"33"></p></li><li> Exploit the fact that the difference in Man=
hattan distance=20
between a board and a neighbor is either +1, -1, or 0, based on the

<p lingdex=3D"35"></p></li><li> When two search nodes have the same Manhatt=

you can break ties however you want, e.g., by comparing either=20
the Hamming or Manhattan distances of the two boards.

<p lingdex=3D"36"></p></li><li> Use a parity argument to determine whether =

<p lingdex=3D"37"><b>Is there an efficient way to solve the 8-puzzle and it=
s generalizations?</b>
Finding a shortest solution to an <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> slider puzzle is
<a href=3D"http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1986/aaai86-027.php">NP-hard</a=

so it's unlikely that an efficient solution exists.

</p><p lingdex=3D"38"><b>What if I'm satisfied with any solution and don't =

Yes, change the priority function to put more weight on the
Manhattan distance, e.g., 100 times the Manhattan distance plus
the number of moves made already.
<a href=3D"http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~ccalabro/essays/15_puzzle.pdf">This pap=

</p><p lingdex=3D"39"><b>Are there better ways to solve 8- and 15-puzzle in=

Yes, there are a number of approaches.

</p><ul>
<p lingdex=3D"40"></p><li> Use the A* algorithm with a better admissible pr=
iority function:
<ul>

<p lingdex=3D"41"></p><li>
<em>Linear conflict</em>: add two to the Manhattan priority function whenev=
er
two tiles are in their goal row (or column) but are reversed relative to
their goal position.

<p lingdex=3D"42"></p></li><li>
<em>Pattern database</em>: For each possible
configuration of 4 tiles and the blank, determine the minimum number of
moves to put just these tiles in their proper position and store these
values in a database. The heuristic value is the maximum over all configura=
tions,
plus the number of moves made so far.
This can reduce the number of search nodes examined for random 15-puzzle in=
stances

Another approach
is to use <a href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search">bid=
irectional
search</a>, where you simultaneously search from the initial board to find =
the goal board
and from the goal board to find the initial board, and have the two search =
trees meet=20
in the middle. Handling the stopping condition is delicate.
